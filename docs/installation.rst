Skeleton Application

If you want a simple and quick start, you can use one of the examples, or clone the base skeleton application::

    git clone https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder-Skeleton.git
    cd Flask-AppBuilder-Skeleton
    python run.py

That's it!!

The git clone is not actually needed for you to run AppBuilder. but it's a good way to start.
